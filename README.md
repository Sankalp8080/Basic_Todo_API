# Basic ToDo Swagger API using JWT Authentication

In this project, I created an API with the help of Swagger. Additionally, I implemented JWT Authentication to access other API calls. Within this API, users can create an account, log in, and subsequently manage their daily life tasks. They can perform various actions such as adding new tasks, modifying, deleting, and marking tasks as done, among others.
